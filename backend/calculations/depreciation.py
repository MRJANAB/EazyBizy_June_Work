"""calculations/depreciation.py — WDV (Written Down Value / reducing-balance)
depreciation for CMAReportInput.

WDV only — no SLM anywhere in this module. Each year:
  depreciation = opening WDV × rate
  closing WDV  = opening WDV − depreciation
carried forward year over year, tracked separately for Building and for
Plant & Machinery + Fixtures (each can have its own rate).

BUG 5 FIX (kept): Gross Block for P&M must use PM_with_contingency.
  PM_with_contingency = PM_base × (1 + contingencyPct)
  GrossBlock = Building + PM_with_contingency + Fixtures
  Depreciation base uses PM_with_contingency (not PM_base).
