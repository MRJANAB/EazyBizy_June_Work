"""
calculations/loan_schedule.py — Term Loan amortisation (CA standard)

BUG 7 FIX: Use half-yearly reducing balance schedule:
  HalfYearlyInstalment = TermLoan / RepaymentHalfYears
  Interest_HalfYearN   = BalanceAtStartOfHalfYear × (interestRate / 2)
  PrincipalRepaid_HalfYearN = HalfYearlyInstalment (0 during moratorium)
  ClosingBalance_HalfYearN  = BalanceAtStartOfHalfYear − PrincipalRepaid_HalfYearN

BUG FIX (moratorium granularity): moratorium used to be converted to whole
years via math.ceil(moratorium_months / 12) — a 6-month moratorium was
silently ROUNDED UP to a full 12-month moratorium (doubling it), while every
display in the report kept showing the original "6 Month(s)" the applicant
actually entered. Moratorium is now tracked in HALF-YEAR units (rounded to
the nearest half-year, since repayment already happens on a half-yearly
cycle), so a 6-month moratorium correctly skips principal for exactly one
half-year, not a full year.
