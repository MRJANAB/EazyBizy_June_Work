calculations/break_even.py — Break-even analysis (CA standard, Section M)

CA Rules:
  Variable  = COGS (Raw Materials) + Marketing (both scale with revenue)
  Fixed     = Labour/Admin + Depreciation + ALL Interest (constant regardless of output)
  BEP Sales = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio
  BEP %     = BEP Sales / Annual Revenue at 100% capacity

CA AUDIT — Payback Period: the old formula was
  Payback = Total Project Cost / Annual Cash Accruals (Year 1 only, annualised)
which repeated the SAME Year-1-only estimate on every one of the 5 rows and
never showed its own working — a reviewer had no way to see WHY a report
said "35.1 months" or verify it. Payback is now computed as a transparent
CUMULATIVE cash-flow recovery: walk Year 1 -> Year 5's actual (declining-
or-growing) annual cash accruals, accumulate them, and find the exact
month the running total first equals the initial investment (interpolating
within the year it happens using that year's own monthly cash-accrual
rate) — the standard CA "payback period" method, and the full year-by-year
working is returned in `payback_calculation` so the report can show it,
not just assert the final number.
