"""Integration tests for POST /api/v1/report/generate — checks that
scheme-level decisions made by schemes/router.py (moratorium overrides,
CGTMSE guarantee fee) actually reach the generated report, not just the
JSON response's key_metrics.

BUG this guards: route_scheme() resolves a scheme-specific moratorium
(e.g. CGTMSE defaults to 6 months via the Rules engine) into
scheme_data["moratorium_months"], but nothing downstream ever read that
key — calculate_loan_schedule() read data.assumptions.moratorium_months
directly, so the scheme's own mandated moratorium was silently ignored
whenever it differed from whatever the applicant's raw input happened to
contain (including the schema's own default of 0).
